# Analyzing-Myanmar-Coup-
In this project, we analyze the detainment, imprisonment and death of civilians in Myanmar Coup of 2021

Using publicly availability citizen reported data as well as Census information, we analyze whether demographic and socio-economic characteristics are related with detainment levels in the Myanmar Coup. The code is written in R. 

The final R markdown report can be found here - file:///C:/Users/abhilashbiswas/Documents/CMU/Programming%20R/Project/Final_report_D2.html
